      "bug title: Incredible in the beginning, completely disappointing 4 months later \n\nbug content: I purchased this with high hopes based on the stellar reviews I found for it when researching for a new router. I work from home a lot and with my line of web development work I certainly would classify myself as a power user. Further more I work in a house hold with numerous roommates and I really wanted something that could handle at minimum a dozen wireless connections at once.When I first hooked up this router I was frankly surprised at how well it handled everything I threw at it in terms of connections and constant use. Then 4 short months later I started noticing as some other reviewers have pointed out that the connections would slow to crawl. Suddenly I sporadically started seen my 5GHz connections go from 110Mbps to a consistent .8Mbps (yes thats not a typo, less than 1Mbps). Initially I sent my internet service provider my full ire thinking that there is no way my relatively new router could be the issue. Time warner understandably does not have the best reputation. They came in found no real issues other than old cabling. They replaced all cables even those outside my home going to the power poles on my block. Nothing changed. Sometimes a reboot of both the router would help, other times it did nothing. Sometimes it would be good for a week or several days but it would start working fine eventually. Then I started seeing this issues happen more frequently until finally at the end of December it was an everyday thing. I then noticed that when I swapped out the router with a borrowed one, or when I bypassed it completely and connected directly to my modem I had no issues at all.This is what brought me to the really diving into the router itself. To date, dozens of reboots later, several firmware updates, and even just reverting the entire damn thing to it's default setup with the oldest firmware available only provided me with a couple of days AT BEST with a working router.Since I am no longer within their 90 complimentary support window I get no help over phone unless I pay. Email support as a lot of others have pointed out takes an eternity to get any sort of response from.I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this product and it's customer support. \n\nbug time: 2017-01-01\nbug author: Enzo C \n\n0    Incredible in the beginning, completely disapp...\ndtype: object\n0    I purchased this with high hopes based on the ...\ndtype: object\n0   2017-01-01\ndtype: object\n0    Enzo C\ndtype: object\n"
